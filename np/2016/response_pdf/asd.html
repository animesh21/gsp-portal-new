      <span>Green Schools Programme Audit 2016</span></h2>
    <p>Dear Principal,</p>
    <p>Thank you for taking part in GSP Audit 2016, an initiative to make your school resource efficient and to inculcate green practices in your students.</p>
    <p>As, Anil Agarwal, founder-director, CSE, rightly said, '...that as they (children) grow older, it is important they begin to understand how human beings and human societies interact with their environment for their survival and their growth, how these human-nature interactions become a part of a society’s culture, and why it is important to rationalize our relationship with our environment.'</p>
    <p>The Green Schools Programme (GSP) is about fostering environmental literacy. It takes the classroom into our lives. The joy is not just in the learning. The joy is in the experience of making change in our environment. We then live the change. GSP has been built on the twin objectives of "Learning by doing" and "making change work" to help schools audit the consumption of natural resources within their premises, and assess themselves as environment managers.</p>
    <p>Like last year, we were overwhelmed with the response we received from across India. More than 2000 schools registered for the audit, and ....submitted the audit. The performance report of the school is based on the data submitted by the schools. Therefore, the school needs to make sure that the data entered is correct to the best of their knowledge. We hope that as the school continues to audit their consumption each year, they will refine the data collection and complete the report with honesty. Our endeavor is to provide India with a green report card of schools with credible data and this can be done only if schools provide accurate data.</p>
    <p>A snapshot GSP Audit 2016 is as follows:</p>

        <figcaption>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
    <p>We hope that your students immersed themselves in the activities and learnt about rainwater harvesting, waste segregation at source, non-polluting modes of transport, eating healthy, etc. While the performance report will give schools the baselines and is an indicator of the progress that the schools make on the environment front - year-on-year, we hope that your school continues to participate each year, and build a generation of environmentally responsible citizens.</p>
    <p>This report will help you move beyond "awareness activities"? such as planting saplings, cleanliness drives, poster-making, etc, which are, undoubtedly, important, but will also help you to identify long term activities that will deliver measurable impacts.</p>
    <p>Hope, that in coming years, your school continues to participate and manage resources efficiently within your school.</p>
    <p>Look forward to receiving your Audit report in 2017!</p>
    <p>Warmly,</p>
    <p>The GSP team</p>

      <span>Green Schools Programme Audit 2016</span></h2>
    <p class="intro-text">Sources of air pollution are many and diverse. But none are as lethal as vehicles as they are responsible for very high exposure. Vehicular emissions take place in the breathing zone of people. Experts say that those who live or work in close proximity to heavily travelled roadways are subject to high levels of exposure.  No wonder that during the past few years, we have been desperately looking out for tools to assess the problem and find ways to combat the menace.</p>
    <section class="remember">
      <h3>Remember:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Circulation of fresh air keeps the mind and body healthy, therefore the total window-floor ratio of a class-room should be more than five per cent.</li>
        <li>The fuel type should be switched from diesel to petrol to CNG to prevent ambient air quality from deteriorating further.</li>
        <li>Your school should motivate most of the permanent population to use non-polluting mode of transport such as walking or cycling, or at least use a sustainably motorized vehicles such as buses, public transport.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <h3>Your School's Performance</h3>
        <p>Your school fulfils almost all the norms of Air Quality check. You can improve by considering the recommendations through the assessment below.  Overall, school has done well in air section.</p>

            <h3>Classrooms Window Floor Ratio (WFR)</h3>
                        <h4>28.17 % Average WFR</h4>
                        <p>Your window-floor ratio is more than ten per cent. It suggests that your school provides fulfills the oxygen requirement of the community by providing more openings for better air circulation. Please note that this result is from the sample you have provided.</p>

            <h3>Ownership of Vehicles</h3>
                        <h4>School does not use or own vehicles</h4>
            <p>This is a very good practice. Some schools do not have their own buses, but hire from a transport contractor. This indicates that students, teaching staff and others are using sustainable modes of transport to commute to school and back. </p>

    <p class="intro-text">The right to water is really the right to life and livelihood. Just as we cannot live without water, a country cannot survive if it is water-stressed. This resource determines our future, and acts as a driving force for our economic growth. Even today, the government admits to ‘not being able to provide' safe drinking water to more than half the country’s population. Poor sanitation and unsafe drinking water account for a substantial part of the disease burden in India, contributing to diarrhea, cholera, typhoid and jaundice.</p>
    <section class="remember">

      <ul>
        <li>Children should get adequate amount of water required per day starting from drinking to flushing to mopping floors to everything.</li>
        <li>Catch rain where it falls. Today, rainwater harvesting has evolved as an appropriate measure to overcome the water scarcity plus water logging due to excessive rains.</li>
        <li>Recharge groundwater. This should be done irrespective of whether the area has high ground water level or low because it's hightime to take preventive measure to stop further depletion of water table.</li>

                        <h4>No</h4>
            <p>We really hope you consider rainwater harvesting methods for your school. Rainwater Harvesting is a good and easy practice. Catching rainwater from any of the catchments (roof, paved and unpaved areas) is cost-effective and you will be able to recharge ground water. Do consider it!</p>

    <p class="intro-text">Waste is another headache arising at an alarming level. Where to dispose waste? How to dispose waste? What to do with the waste? We feel one of the easiest solution could be waste segregation. We should feed it into our system that no matter what, we will segregate our waste, even if it gets mixed after it goes out from our homes/schools.</p>
    <section class="remember">
      <h3>Remember:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Segregation at source is very important.</li>
        <li>Every class should have minimum of two dustbins to collect wet and dry waste.</li>
        <li>Schools should have a composting facility to manage the wet waste in the school premises itself.</li>
        <li>Send e-waste to Authorised dealers.</li>
        <li>Do not burn waste in school premises, especially horticultural waste. Alternatively, composting should be done by horticultural waste.</li>
        <li>Waste should be sent to designated dumping or landfill sites.</li>
        <li>Schools should have a waste policy that is to be practiced in schools.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <h3>Your School's Performance</h3>
        <p>You have done average in this section. Your school manages most of the waste. We hope that through the assessment below you will take what is required to make your school a waste management efficient school.</p>
