We discover many solid wastes around us every time but looking at the current system of garbage collection in our country and their recycling, composting or even gasification looks quite problematic. Thus, we propose the implementation of SmartBins, Environment Stabilizer Machines (ESMs) and Seed Platforms. These are completely sensor based and have a very little chances of demolishment.  These ideas follow fundamental mechanics and simple components feasibly. ",Y,"students are not allowed to bring plastic bottles in school,    plastic straws and spoons are also not used in the canteens, students carry jute bags ",,Our school has twelve floors in total so we plan to build ten SmartBin and two ESM to cover all our school and make it accessible to almost everyone. The Green Mind also plans to conduct actions where students are taught how to use SmartBins and ESMs,"The Smart Bin and ESM project will be very helpful for waste managing. It’ll distinguish between wet, dry and metallic wastes.  The Smart Bin project is basically used for waste segregation. Basically the ESM will work on the exchange system, in exchange for plastic we will be providing greenery. Both the projects use the technical assistance.","Implementation of all the ideas are feasible, as mentioned above. If we take SmartBin then its estimated cost is INR 9,500 (maximum). And the estimated cost for ESM and Plant Platforms will not exceed INR 50,000. So, the total value we have is 2 Lacs",2 shortterm benefits: SmartBins keep storing waste and maintain the environment clean. The seed from ESM will play vital role in keeping campus air safe. 2 longterm benefits: It is not a primary goal but implementation of SmartBins & ESMs enables greenery.
