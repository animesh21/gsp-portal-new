      <span>Green Schools Programme Audit 2017-2018</span></h2>
    <p>Dear Principal,</p>
    <p>Thank you for taking part in GSP Audit 2017-2018, an initiative to make your school resource efficient and to inculcate green practices in your students. As Anil Agarwal, founder-director, CSE, rightly said, '...as they (children) grow older, it is important they begin to understand how human beings and human societies interact with their environment for their survival and their growth, how these human-nature interactions become a part of a society's culture, and why it is important to rationalize our relationship with our environment.' </p>
    <p> The Green Schools Programme (GSP) takes the students outside the classroom and helps them learn with joy. GSP has been built on the twin objectives of "Learning by doing" and "making change work" to help schools audit the consumption of natural resources within their premises, and assess themselves as environment managers. </p>
    <p> Like last year, we were overwhelmed with the response we received from across India. More than 2800 schools registered for the Audit, and around 1200 schools submitted the Audit - a jump of 70 per cent, when compared to last year. </p>
    <p> The performance report of the school is based on the data submitted by the schools. Therefore, the school needs to make sure that the data entered is correct to the best of their knowledge. We hope that as the school continues to audit their consumption each year, they will refine the data collection and complete the report with honesty. We hope that your students immersed themselves in the activities and learnt about rainwater harvesting, waste segregation at source, non-polluting modes of transport, eating healthy, etc. While the performance report will give schools the baselines and is an indicator of the progress that the schools make on the environment front year-on-year, we hope that your school continues to participate each year, and build a generation of environmentally responsible citizens. </p>
    <p> The report will help your school in assessing the initiatives undertaken and move towards filling in the gaps by the next GSP Audit. Our focus will be on measuring the change over the previous year's performance. The school's actions for bettering the environment and sensitivity towards environment will be looked at from the baseline year (the year the school did the Audit for the first time). And the degree of change will be appreciated and recognised. To find out how schools have brought about change, please take a look at the videos available at www.greenschoolsprogramme.org</p>
    <p> We have dispatched the certificates, and if you don't receive by April 20, 2018, please email (details given below). Hope you have downloaded the digital certificates of all those whose names were provided online. </p>
    <p> Hope, that in coming years, your school continues to participate and manage resources efficiently within your school. The GSP Audit 2018 will open by mid-year, and we look forward to receiving your Audit report by the deadline!</p>
    <p> Warmly, </p>
    <p> The GSP team</p>

      <span>Green Schools Programme Audit 2017-2018</span></h2>
    <p>Sources of air pollution are many and diverse. But none are as lethal as vehicles as they are responsible for very high exposure. Vehicular emissions take place in the breathing zone of people. Experts say that those who live or work in close proximity to heavily travelled roadways are subject to high levels of exposure.  No wonder that during the past few years, we have been desperately looking out for tools to assess the problem and find ways to combat the menace.</p>
    <section class="remember">
      <h3>Remember:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Circulation of fresh air keeps the mind and body healthy, therefore the total window-floor ratio of a class-room should be more than five per cent.</li>
        <li>The fuel type should be switched from diesel to petrol to CNG to prevent ambient air quality from deteriorating further.</li>
        <li>Your school should motivate most of the permanent population to use non-polluting mode of transport such as walking or cycling, or at least use a sustainably motorized vehicles such as buses, public transport.</li>

    <p>Your school grounds can provide excellent educational opportunities for creating awareness about land resources and the natural world around you, as well as the land-use pattern. The biological diversity 
      supported by an area is a good indicator of its ecological well-being. A proper management of land resources can transform the grounds into biologically diverse outdoor classrooms and healthy open spaces.</p>

        <li>Congestion on land (more buildings and inadequate green cover) leads to pressure on resources and hence on our

        <li>We all know that a mind with plenty of oxygen has a greater power to grasp things. And for more oxygen we need more trees - our only oxygen factory.</li>

    <p>The right to water is really the right to life and livelihood. Just as we cannot live without water, a country cannot survive if it is water-stressed. This resource determines our future, and acts as a driving force for our economic growth. Even today, the government admits to not being able to provide' safe drinking water to more than half the country's population. Poor sanitation and unsafe drinking water account for a substantial part of the disease burden in India, contributing to diarrhea, cholera, typhoid and jaundice.</p>
    <section class="remember">
      <h3>Remember:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Children should get adequate amount of water required per day starting from drinking to flushing to mopping floors to everything.</li>
        <li>Catch rain where it falls. Today, rainwater harvesting has evolved as an appropriate measure to overcome the water scarcity plus water logging due to excessive rains.</li>
        <li>Recharge groundwater. This should be done irrespective of whether the area has high ground water level or low because it's high time to take preventive measure to stop further depletion of water table.</li>

    <p>Waste is another headache arising at an alarming level. Where to dispose waste? How to dispose waste? What to do with the waste? We feel one of the easiest solution could be waste segregation. We should feed it into our system that no matter what, we will segregate our waste, even if it gets mixed after it goes out from our homes/schools.</p>

      <h3>Remember:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Segregation at source is very important.</li>
        <li>Every class should have minimum of two dustbins to collect wet and dry waste.</li>
        <li>Schools should have a composting facility to manage the wet waste in the school premises itself.</li>
        <li>Send e-waste to Authorised dealers.</li>
        <li>Do not burn waste in school premises, especially horticultural waste. Alternatively, composting should be done by horticultural waste.</li>
        <li>Waste should be sent to designated dumping or landfill sites.</li>
        <li>Schools should have a waste policy that is to be practiced in schools.</li>
