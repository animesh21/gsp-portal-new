  <a href="http://www.greenschoolsprogramme.org/audit/" target="_blank">www.greenschoolsprogramme.org/audit/</a></p>
<p>The GSP Audit 2016, like  every year, is a combination of knowledge, fun activities and learning,
  where you would not only  be able to understand your environment better, but also take steps to conserve  precious natural resources and be a change maker! </p>
<p>Here are some tips to  remember before you start the audit: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify a team of  around 10 students for each of the six sections of the Audit </li>
  <li>Each section will be  supervised by teachers and administrative staffs </li>
  <li>Try to answer the subjective  type of questions first (Yes/ No) </li>
  <li>Then identify the questions that require monitoring over a period  of time </li>
  <li>Remember to send  pictures of teams conducting the audit </li>
  <li>Remember, the FAQs are  always there for your help at:<br>
    <u>www.greenschoolsprogramme.org/faqs/</u></li>
</ul>
<p>Hurry up and start  filling the answers â€“ your school has three months to submit the Audit! </p>
<p>We hope your school  completes the audit this year within Oct 31, 2016 and become a green school at  the earliest. The CSE rating will be valid for three years. </p>
<p>The focus this year is  Water, and the Waterwise manual will soon be available for sale on Flipkart and  Amazon. </p>
