      <span>Green Schools Programme Audit 2019-2020</span></h2>
    <p>Dear Principal,</p>
    <p>We thank you for taking part in the GSP Audit 2019-20. We hope the exercise helped to make your school resource efficient and inculcate green practices in your students.
    </p> 
    <p>As you are aware, the Green Schools Programme (GSP) takes the students outside the classroom and helps them learn with joy. GSP has been built on the twin objectives of &#39;learning by doing&#39; and helping schools audit the consumption of natural resources within their premises and assess themselves as environment managers.
</p>
    <p>This year, more than 1700 schools from across the country submitted the audit. The GSP national environmental report for schools looks promising&#8211;1389 schools segregate waste at source, 962 schools practice composting and 631 schools give their e-waste to authorized dealers. 818 schools harvest rainwater, half of these recharge the groundwater and 220 schools store for use.<strong> BUT</strong> 79 per cent schools are dependent on ground water. The number of schools burning waste has reduced from last year but 18 per cent schools still burn waste. More than 300 schools sell packaged food and more than 550 schools distribute packaged food as refreshments during school events. There is a long way to go! 
 </p>
    <p>For the last few years, water and waste have been the focus areas, i.e. have detailed questions. This year, in addition to water and waste, energy section was detailed with emphasis on renewable sources of energy. 218 schools reported the use of solar energy, 21 schools reported using biogas and eight reported using wind energy.</b> 
</p>

<p>We hope the performance report, based on the data submitted by the school, will be useful to further strengthen existing practices and introduce new sustainable practices. For GSP Audit 2020, we request the school leadership as well as the teachers heading the audit sections to take advantage of the audit in raising awareness on one of the most challenging crises of our time&#8211;climate change.  Since the audit already tracks all the critical elements (mobility, energy consumption, food consumption, water and sanitation and solid waste management) that directly or indirectly contribute to global heating, GSP Audit 2020 will reinforce the climate change linkages while retaining its original format. <strong> Stay tuned for further details! </strong>
</p>
<p>
  As we wind down GSP Audit 2019, please note the following: 
</p>

 <ol style="list-style-type: japanese-formal !important;"> 
           
    <li style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px;">The performance report will help in assessing the initiatives undertaken by your school and move towards filling the gaps before the next GSP Audit.</li> 
    <li style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; margin-top:6px;">Hope you have downloaded the response report and digital certificates of all those whose names were provided online.</li>    
    <li style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; margin-top:6px;">Make sure that the data entered is correct for GSP Audit 2020. We hope that as the school continues to audit their consumption every year, they will refine the data collection process and complete the report with full honesty.</li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; margin-top:6px;">Our focus will be on <strong> measuring the change over the previous years&#39; performances. </strong> And the degree of change will be appreciated as well as recognized.</li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; margin-top:6px;">School hard copy certificates were dispatched in end&#8211;February and hope you have received the certificates </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; margin-top:6px;">To know more about the sections, please refer to the knowledge bank on the GSP website: <a href="https://www.greenschoolsprogramme.org/" style="color:blue;">www.greenschoolsprogramme.org</a>. There is some interesting material on Energy available on the <a href="https://www.greenschoolsprogramme.org/knowledge-bank/energy/gsp-solar-in-schools-initiative-2019-20/" style="color:blue;">GSP website</a></li>
  </ol>
  <br/>
  <p>
      With time running out in a climate-risked world, schools are urged to bring to the attention of youth the urgency, causes and consequences of climate change in a manner that they can relate to and act upon. Only when students make informed choices to make transformative changes in their lifestyle outside of school hours, too, to reduce their emissions related to mobility, energy, excessive consumption, etc., will collective efforts to raise committed environmental actors succeed. We hope that in the coming years, your school continues to participate and push the envelope for change.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>The GSP Audit 2020 will open by July 2020, and we look forward to receiving your audit report by the deadline.
</p>
    <p>Warmly,</p>

Based on the analysis of the sustainable practices adopted by your school, your school has been rated Green. Do continue your efforts and sustain the momentum - being continuously Green is not easy and we have noticed that when a school (or the students and teachers) drops its guard or fail to provide accurate data, they slide to a yellow or orange or red category. Do ensure your school continues to adhere (but not limited to) to the following, and push the envelope for change: </p>

Your school has been rated Yellow and our analysis of your school data and practices, reveals that your school is managing the resources within the school premises judiciously, BUT there is scope for improvement. We have also noticed that a few schools that were rated Green in the previous year may have been rated Yellow due to submission of inaccurate data, change in green practices, etc. Some of the practices recommended for a Green rating (but not limited to) are:</p>

    <p>Air pollution is responsible for close to 13 per cent of deaths in India and its burden is highest in northern states of Delhi, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. In fact, an average Indian will live 1.7 years longer if the country is able to clean its air.</p>
    <p>Air pollution has adverse effects on children, specifically. It has been found that children in polluted environment grow up with smaller lungs. Sources of air pollution are many and diverse. But none are as lethal as vehicles because they are responsible for very high exposure. Vehicular emissions take place in the breathing zone of people. Experts say that those who live or work in close proximity to heavily travelled roadways are subject to high levels of exposure. No wonder that during the past few years, we have been desperately looking out for tools to assess the problem and find ways to combat the menace.
   </p>
   <p>To know more about GSP&#39;s initiative on air pollution and explore the resource material, please go to the <a href="https://www.greenschoolsprogramme.org/knowledge-bank/gsp-air-pollution-seminar-2019-20/" style="color:blue;">GSP website.</a>

      <h3>Remember:</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: japanese-formal !important;">
<li>Your school can make an impact and ensure cleaner air in the surroundings by opting for carpooling and shifting to CNG run vehicles, if CNG is available in your area (CNG is a cleaner fuel).</li>
<li>Encourage most of the permanent population to use non-polluting modes of transport such as walking or cycling, or use sustainable motorized vehicles such as buses and other public transport. Students in several schools have come up with new and innovative ways to discourage the school population to use private vehicles and incentivize them to use public transport or car pool.</li>
<li>Practices to achieve cleaner air will bear little result without attempts to ensure that there is circulation of fresh air. Fresh air keeps mind and body healthy, which helps students concentrate better and stay alert. The total window-floor ratio of a classroom should therefore be more than at least five per cent.</li>

    <p>The impact of global warming has already reached scorching levels, and is rising rapidly. Saving energy is the first step to energy conservation. Switching off electrical gadgets when they are not in use and transitioning from bulbs to CFLs/LEDs are great ways to start. Opting for rooftop or building-integrated small-scale solar systems is an  easy way to conserve electricity sustainably and cut down on your school's future electricity costs! They help minimise transmission and distribution losses, as the generated power is consumed locally. You can check out the latest schemes for solar roof top installations in institutions on <a href="https://seci.co.in/" style="color: blue;">https://seci.co.in/.</a> </p>

    <p>A recent report published states that the food diversity on plate worldwide has reduced by 75 percent since the 1990s. This has cost everyone in terms of deteriorating human health and environment. In India, over 100 kinds of foods wild, cultivated and uncultivated form a part of the regular diet. Nutritional analyses of these diets show that these foods can counter malnutrition including micro-nutrient malnutrition such as Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD).</p>
<p>Food has been at the centre of policy debate in India for many years, as more than 35 percent of the country's children under five suffer from pacts of malnutrition including stunted growth and under-weight. Meanwhile, World Obesity Federation warns that by 2030, there will be 27 million obese children in India. Given India's dubious distinction of carrying the twin burden of under nutrition and overfeeding, we need to be extra cautious.
We all are aware about the ill-effects of Ultra Processed Packaged Food (UPPF) that has high fat, sugar and salt (HFSS) content. This UPPF category is one of the most popular categories in today's food market.

    <p>As per Model Building Bye-Laws, 2016, maximum ground coverage in a school building should not exceed 35 per cent. Your school grounds can provide excellent educational opportunities for creating awareness about land resources, natural world around you and the land-use pattern. The biological diversity supported by an area is a good indicator of its ecological well-being. A proper management of land resources can transform the grounds into biologically diverse outdoor classrooms and healthy open spaces.</p>
    <p>As per the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (RTE), 2009, a school should have an all-weathered school building with a playground, a kitchen (for cooking mid-meal), separate toilets for boys and girls, library, barrier-free access, etc.</p>

    <p>The right to water is really the right to life and livelihood. Just as we cannot live without water, a country cannot survive if it is water-stressed. This resource determines our future and acts as a driving force for our economic growth. Even today, the government admits to not being able to provide safe drinking water to more than half the country's population. Poor sanitation and unsafe drinking water account for a substantial part of the disease burden in India, contributing to diarrhoea, cholera, typhoid and jaundice. </p>

      <h3>Remember:</h3>
      <ol style="list-style-type: japanese-formal !important;"> 
        <li>Children should get adequate amount of water required per day from drinking to flushing to mopping floors to everything.</li>
        <li>Catch rain where it falls. Today, rainwater harvesting has evolved as an appropriate measure to overcome the water scarcity as well as water logging due to excessive rains.</li>
        <li>Recharge groundwater. As per Central GroundWater Board (CGWB), around 39% of the analysed wells showed decline in groundwater level in various parts of the country. We must try to reduce the dependence on groundwater to stop further depletion of water table. Other measures can be harvesting more rainwater; treating and reusing waste water; and recharging groundwater.</li>

    <p>Do you know how much solid waste (paper, plastics, food waste etc) Delhi produces? 10,000 tonnes a day. We dump it all into landfills, which are overflowing and which pollute the environment. Moreover, there is no land available to create more landfills. We face day-to-day problems regarding waste management. Where to dispose of waste? How to dispose of waste? What to do with the waste?</p>
    <p>Schools, by following efficient waste management practices, can play a leading role in setting examples, creating a public opinion, and ridding India of this menace.

      <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; color: blue;">What&#39;s New</p>
      <p>
        The year 2019-20 was marked by increased focus on energy. GSP&#39;s Solar on Schools initiative that was piloted in Himachal Pradesh saw a range of activities such as workshops, science fairs, etc. We started the year off with the publication Rethink Energy which helps in gauging energy consumption patterns and improving energy use in schools. Other resource materials include a board game, colouring book, fact sheets and videos. All this material can be found on the GSP Website: <a href="https://www.greenschoolsprogramme.org/knowledge-bank/energy/gsp-solar-in-schools-initiative-2019-20/" style="color:blue;">https://www.greenschoolsprogramme.org/knowledge-bank/energy/gsp-solar-in-schools-initiative-2019-20/</a>
      </p>

      <p>We look forward to continue working together in the coming year with renewed enthusiasm. We hope that you find the performance report and resource material useful. Thank you for your participation in the GSP Audit and being active environmental change makers!</p>

       <p>Please find below a snapshot of the books released by CSE</p>
